# Typescript node starter


* This repo contains code I use when building restful APIs with Express, Node & Typescript

* I've left any database ORM configuration out as my preference for ORMs may change over time. 

* This repo aims at getting the basics up and running while being flexible to whatever you want to use on the server (i.e. you can easily setup Prisma, Typeorm, GraphQL, redis etc.)
